I sniff for drugs.
</p>
Bacteria, especially actinomycetes, have a reputation for biosynthesizing chemicals that are of clinical or biotechnological use.  Over half of the drugs approved by the FDA in the past decade are of natural origin and many more are synthetically derived from natural scaffolds.  I get my kicks from a) computationally mining genome data from these bacteria to find biosynthetic gene clusters (and predict their chemical products), b) understanding the regulation of these compounds (e.g. figuring out how to coax them produce molecule when they don't natively produce under "normal" conditions), and c) developing methods for engineering the gene content of these clusters towards generating new and exciting compounds.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I am the Head of Experimental Genomics at <a href='http://www.warpdrivebio.com'>Warp Drive Bio</a>, which has built the most massive bacterial genome database in history...ever...in an effort to exploit gene cluster diversity for the discovery of novel therapeutics.  I will be joining UW-Madison in 08/2015 as a member of <a href='http://currielab.wisc.edu/'>Cameron Currie's lab</a> to continue my research on secondary metabolites, their role in nature, and the possibility of enrichment for novel compounds of therapeutic use.  I will be taking an evolutionary approach to probe the chemical diversity of polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide gene clusters in our model system for drug discovery.
</p>
<p>
The model system to study this phenomenon in the <a href='http://currielab.wisc.edu/'>Currie Lab</a> is nothing short of fascinating...  Certain ants are farmers.  These ants farm (and later eat) a fungus, which is highly rich in nutrients.  Like human farmers, the ants have been faced with the challenge of pathogenic decimation of the "crop" (think the Irish Potato Famine).  To circumvent this challenge, millions of years ago evolution selected for a symbiotic relationship in which the ants would be coated actinomycetes that synthesized chemical compounds that could protect against bad, nasty organisms trying to steal their food.  Today, the actinobacteria that coat these ants are specific to a given colony.
</p>
<p>
These bacteria appear to be a) highly prolific in secondary metabolite capability, b) highly variable in their biosynthetic gene cluster content from ant colony to colony, and c) their genomes show much evidence of horizontal transfer of secondary metaoblite gene clusters.  Our hypothesis is that not only can these actinomycetes provide anti-biotic and anti-fungal protection of the ant's cultivar, they may be a prolific discovery avenue for compounds of human therapeutic and biotechnological use.  The likelihood of a gene cluster under high selective pressure to be medically important is quite high when you consider that millions of years of selective evolution are on our side.
</p>
<p>
Nature is spending a lot of energy to make the molecules, so it follows that they must be making them for a reason...and in a collaboration with the <a href='https://clardy.med.harvard.edu/'>Clardy Lab</a> at Harvard we hope to prove exactly that.
